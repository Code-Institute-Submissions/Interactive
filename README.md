# Interactive Front-End

A Code Institute Interactive Front-End Project

## Getting Started

Maploc is a simple app, built from the powerful Google Map API. 
The Google Places API, with the new autocomplete feature can give a 
user suggestions as to what they intend inputing, 
this makes it easy when your not sure the spelling of a city.
The API in short makes it easy for users to locate places of travel in a fretless environment.
The name Maploc is just shortening of 'map' and 'location'.

## UX

The parameters for the assignment highlighted these features: 
  i. For users to select a destination 
  ii. For users to be allowed to search
  iii. For users to find specific places
  
The design is based on a single page architecture. Most of the feature are based in the header. 
The header contains all the important features, like, the search box, the query results, select-options and radio buttons. 
It has a back drop with a 100vh. 
The search or Query features are located in the center of the page with the returned results right under it.
