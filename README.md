# Interactive Front-End

A Code Institute Interactive Front-End Project

## Getting Started

Maploc is a simple app, built from the powerful Google Map API. 
The Google Places API with the new autocomplete feature can give a 
user suggestions as to what they intend inputted, and 
this makes it easy when your not sure the spelling of a city.
The API, in short, makes it easy for users to locate places of travel in a fretless environment.
The name Maploc is just a shortening of 'map' and 'location'.

## UX

The parameters for the project highlighted these features: 
  i. For users to select a destination.  
  ii. For users to be allowed to search. 
  iii. For users to find specific places.
  
The design is based on a single page architecture. Most of the features are based in the header. 
The header contains all the important features, like, the search box, the query results, select-options and radio buttons. 
It has a backdrop image with a 100vh. 
The search or Query features are located in the centre of the page with the returned results right under it.

## Testing

The app has been tested on these devices, IPhoneX/6/7/7+/8+, Desktop and they resize very well. But beyond these listed devices I can't guarantee accuracy.

The Google map javascript API used response well and does the job. 
So far the app works perfectly well in all the browsers tested on.
Full test response can be found in the table below.
